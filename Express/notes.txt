Routing

app.METHOD(PATH, HANDLER_METHOD)

METHOD can be any HTTP call - GET, OPTIONS, DELETE, POST

Serving Static files

Static files can be served using the builtin middleware express.static

to initialize:

app.use(VIRTUAL_PATH, express.static(DIRECTORY))
virtual path is optional

Must See: https://expressjs.com/en/starter/faq.html

Appart from the middleware mechanism that is implented app wide, it is possible to write chained route handlers that are executed in sequence.

In a chain of route handles the intermediate methods are passed a next method which they call to execute the next function in line, until they reach the method responsible for returning response.
