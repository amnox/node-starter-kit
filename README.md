**Youtube Video:** An excellent 1 hr tutorial by *Programming with Mosh*, along with this video he has an excellent node.js course, check it out [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TlB_eWDSMt4).

**W3 Examples:** Solved examples of the topics covered by W3Schools tutorial of node.js. [File Upload](https://www.w3schools.com/nodejs/nodejs_uploadfiles.asp) and [Node Mailer](https://www.w3schools.com/nodejs/nodejs_email.asp) tutorials are a must here

```
npm i -g formidable nodemailer
```

**Express.js Documentation:** I chose express.js as the framework for node because it is unopiniated i.e. it simply provides a convenient abstraction over node's http layer without hinting towards a particular development practice or project structure.

It dosen't feel too different from node js and has powerful middleware mechanism that can be used to implement various aspects of app - logging, auth, error handling etc.

Although the creators of express don't advocate any particular development pattern as express.js is built to support apps of different sizes, but it's still necessary for new developers to know a basic starting point to be able to effectively manage different concerns in the app like models, controllers etc.
